🚗 Parking Garage Management System



📌 Overview

This project presents the design of a Parking Garage Management System developed for Eduvos.
The system addresses inefficiencies in parking space usage and congestion by enabling parking reservations, real-time occupancy tracking, automated payments, and license plate recognition.

🎯 Problem Statement

Eduvos required a system to:

Reduce congestion inside parking garages

Improve parking space utilization

Allow users to reserve parking in advance

Track vehicles entering and exiting the garage automatically

👥 Actors
